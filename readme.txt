II.  NOTES TO ENRICH YOUR GAMING LIFE

	Yes, that's right, it's time for a word from your witty development team.  Thought we got lost in the corporate shuffle, ey?  Naw...we're leaving that to you in our newest brainchild:  CyberStorm 2: Corporate Wars.

	Quite frankly, for game developers writing a readme is very similar to writing a thesis: it's long, boring, and not many people read it anyway.  So here's our various and sundry notes, not compiled in any particularly pleasing fashion because, quite frankly, you should be playing the game and not reading about it.<g>

WINDOWS

	Unlike most Windows applications, CyberStorm 2 is designed to be an immersive application.  This means it tries to take your whole screen and make your forget about work for awhile.  Thus, if you task-switch (Alt-Tab) out of the game you may find the Windows Taskbar is visible when returning to the game.  The best solution to this is to not task-switch out of the game.  If you really like to task switch, tell CyberStorm 2 this by selecting the Run In A Window option in the Windows Preferences.  This will make CyberStorm 2 behave like a normal Windows application.  Otherwise, if you want an immersive experience (c'mon, you know you do!) then choose any other Windows option and the Stay On Top option and forget about your worries for awhile.

	If you ever want to restore all your preference settings to default, delete the file STORM.SET from the directory where STORM.EXE resides.  The next time you run the game, a new STORM.SET with the default values will be generated.

WINDOWS LIMITATIONS

	Yes, as you know, there are some.  But these comments have to do with the CyberStorm 2 Preferences/Windows tab:

	CyberStorm 2 does not support the Run In A Window option if your desktop resolution is set to 640X480 pixels.  This is because CyberStorm 2 is designed to run in a minimum resolution of 640X480 and so we don't have enough additional space on your screen to show the window title bar.  If you try to force this change, your game display resolution will be reset to Default.

	CyberStorm 2 does not support the Smallest Display Resolution ( 640X480 ) if your desktop is using Large Fonts.  There just isn't enough screen space for us to show all the cool art AND large fonts. If you try to force this change, your game display resolution will be reset to Default.  If you really want large fonts and a lower game resolution, try putting CyberStorm2 in Medium Display Resolution ( 800 X 600 ).

AUTOSAVES

	There are two kinds of AutoSaves: campaign autosaves (titled "autoXXXX.cbs", where XXXX is the autosave game counter) and combat autosaves ( titled "BattleStart.cbs").  Campaign autosaves happen at the end of every strategic turn after returning from combat.  These autosaves help you recapture the state of your herc force and overall career.  Combat autosaves happen at the beginning of combat, before any casualties occur.  Even if you are in turn-based combat, there is only one combat autosave per combat session, not every combat turn.  These autosaves can help you to try different strategies in the same combat situation.

	Note that AutoSaves have no overwrite confirmation, so if you restore to a saved game that was saved early in your current campaign and continue playing from that point, autosaves for later strategic turns will be overwritten.  Plus, there is only one BattleStart.cbs at any given time.

	In general, the AutoSave feature is meant to enhance the game playing experience by giving you fallback saved games in case your campaign moves in an unanticipated direction. However, AutoSave is no substitute for smart saves.  Remember that campaign autosaves are always at the end of a strategic turn, and so contain damaged stuff from the previous battle (if any).

FINDING HELP IN THE GAME

	There is help available throughout the game.  The rule of thumb is that if passing the mouse over an object causes a description to flash in the CyberStorm Status Line, then clicking the right mouse button on that object will bring up detailed help.  For example, while looking at the main Hercbase screen, move the cursor over the Command Center.  You will see text saying something like "Enter Command Center" in the Status Line.  Now right click on the Command Center and a message box will pop up with detailed information about the Command Center.

GENERAL STUFF

	If you are running CyberStorm 2 on a computer that is close to our minimum requirements (see above), you may benefit from running CyberStorm 2 in a 256 color mode (as opposed to High Color or True Color).  CyberStorm 2 runs a bit faster that way, and you won't miss out on any cool art as all the game art is in 256 colors.

	Due to device driver variations, setting the volume of background music in the General section of the Preferences may not always work.  If it doesn't, try using the control panel in Windows.

	The CyberStorm Install will use a cooler background bitmap if your machine is running in a higher color mode than 256 colors (like True Color).  Similarly, the CyberStorm Autoplay will show an additional slick animation in color modes greater than 256 colors.  However, note that the Game itself runs faster in 256 color mode.

	Oh, and _real_ CyberStorm fans endure the credits. <g>
